          A major influence and strong foundation of family comes from growing up in a Catholic family.
          Her mother and father instilled the strong value of faith and family building up a foundation
          for generations to follow by.

          Friends and family go hand and hand with her. The friendships she builds last a lifetime and
          making memories with one another always is at the top of the list.

          Growing up in a family of seven on a farm outside of a small town in Iowa, farming is a major
          part of her life. Being on the farm exposes you to many different life experiences and those
          are some of her favorites. Learning to operate and drive the John Deere tractor at age 13
          helping her dad harvest corn, beans, and hay. Raising farm animals including cows, pigs, and
          chickens. Learning all about gardening and raising crops her favorites being tomatoes,
          strawberries and zucchini.

            Last of all making time to enjoy life and have fun with her family and friends. Many times,
